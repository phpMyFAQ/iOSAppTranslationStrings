These files are the translation pattern for the iOS App phpMyFAQ. The app is for all iPhones and iPads with the iOS Version 8.0 or higher. If you have translate a new language or you have some corrections for existing languages you can send me a mail to support@q4u.digital or create a new issue or make a pull request here on github.

Please write an mail or issue in german or english.

Localizable.strings Files :
Only the right value is the translation and the characters with a % in front are placeholder for variable values. The chars \r\n don't delete. This are characters to set a new line.

In all other *.strings Files are the right value the translation. Donâ€™t modify the comments (/** ... */) and the left value.
